This project uses **TensorFlow** neural networks to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset, a well-known collection of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9) widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of image recognition. The project begins with preprocessing the dataset, which includes normalizing pixel values, reshaping the images, and converting the labels to a one-hot encoded format. The core of the project involves training a convolutional neural network (**CNN**) on the MNIST data. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, making them more effective than traditional fully connected networks for visual data. The model is then evaluated on a test set to assess its accuracy and generalization performance. Moving forward, future work could explore more advanced architectures, such as deeper CNNs or hybrid models, and consider deploying the trained model for real-world applications, enabling faster and more efficient digit recognition.
